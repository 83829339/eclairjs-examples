===================

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/EclairJS/eclairjs-examples)

**EclairJS** is a JavaScript client for Apache Spark which is made up of thread components, each with it's own project, [EclairJS Node](https://github.com/EclairJS/eclairjs-node), [EclairJS Nashorn](https://github.com/EclairJS/eclairjs-nashorn/) and , [EclairJS Examples](https://github.com/EclairJS/eclairjs-examples/).

## EclairJS Node
The purpose of **EclairJS Node** is to enable JavaScript/NodeJS developers to program against [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).  **EclairJS Node** provides an API in NodeJS for the [Apache Spark API](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/index.html) and a remote client for a node application.  **EclairJS Node** is dependent on the **EclairJS Nashorn** component.

## EclairJS Nashorn
The purpose of **EclairJS Nashorn** is to expose the [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) programming model to JavaScript.  **EclairJS Nashorn** provides support for JavaScript in [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) and a framework that supports various applications including **Eclairjs Node**, a REPL and Jupyter Notebooks.


## EclairJS Examples
The purpose of **EclairJS Examples** is to contain the EclairJS Node examples, the EclairJS Nashhorn examples,  along with example Jupyter Notebooks.
